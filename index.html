                  <p>He had previously served as the fourth Vice-President of Kenya for ten years from 1978 to 1988 under President Daniel arap Moi.
                    He also held cabinet ministerial positions in the Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi governments, including as minister for Finance 
                    (1969–1981) under Kenyatta, and Minister for Home Affairs (1982–1988) and Minister for Health (1988–1991) under Moi</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p> On 29 December 2002, still nursing injuries from the motor vehicle accident and in a wheel chair, Mwai Kibaki was sworn in as the third President 
                    and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces 
                    of the Republic of Kenya,in front of thousands of cheering supporters at the historic Uhuru Park within Nairobi City.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>In January 2003, Kibaki introduced a free primary education initiative, which brought over 1 million children who would not have been able
                     to afford school the chance to attend.[36] The initiative received positive attention, including praise from Bill Clinton,
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>President Kibaki, the economist whose term as Finance minister in the 1970s is widely celebrated as outstanding, 
                    did much as president to repair the damage done to the country's economy during the 24-year reign of his predecessor, President Moi.
                     Compared to the Moi years, Kenya was much better managed, by far more competent public sector personnel, and was much transformed</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>Kibaki successfully championed by President Kibaki in the Kenyan constitutional referendum in 2010 was a major triumph and achievement, 
                    which went a long way into addressing Kenya's governance and institutional challenges. </p>
                  <p>On 9 April 2013 at a public inauguration ceremony a proud looking but rather worn President Kibaki handed over the Kenyan presidency to his successor </p>
